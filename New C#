3. What is Common Language Runtime (CLR)?
The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a component of the Microsoft .NET Framework that manages the execution of .NET applications. It is responsible for loading and executing the code written in various .NET programming languages, 
including C#, VB.NET, F#, and others.
When a C# program is compiled, the resulting executable code is in an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). This code is not machine-specific,
and it can run on any platform that has the CLR installed. When the CIL code is executed, the CLR compiles it into machine code that can be executed by the processor.
